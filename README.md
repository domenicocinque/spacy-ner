# NER with SpaCy

NER pipeline with SpaCy on the CoNLL-2003 dataset, based on the [example project](https://github.com/explosion/projects/tree/v3/pipelines/ner_demo).

The training pipeline can be run with `weasel run all`. After training, a streamlit demo can be run with `weasel run visualize-model` and a pip egg can be created with `weasel run package`.
